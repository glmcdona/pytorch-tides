# PyTorch-Tides
PyTorch-Tides is a global tidal chart prediction modelling project built using PyTorch. What's unique about this project is that it can predict the tide chart for any location in the world since it's fit to global satellite sea level readings from Jason-3.

This leverages significant code from (PyTides)[https://github.com/sam-cox/pytides] for the tidal constituent modelling.

Project is in active development; more details will be added here as the project advances.
